# LED Hallway

This takes input from motion sensors, a button, and a switch to activate a series of LED's lining the moulding in our entrance hallway.

The switch turns lights always-on, the button changes the color mode, and the motion sensors activate the lights in like a sequential runway-fashion, from the location of that particular motion sensor, outward.

An excuse for me to learn how to solder, play with addressable LED strips, and program an Arduino micro-controller
