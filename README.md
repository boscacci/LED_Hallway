# LED Hallway

See my [detailed project log here on Medium](https://medium.com/@boscacci/diy-motion-sensing-hallway-leds-wip-825c604d61b8?source=friends_link&sk=c727c7602234de585714f12be69461e3).

Multiple motion sensors trigger addressable RGB LED strips in my apartment's entrance hallway.

An excuse for me to learn Arduino micro-controller programming and make fun home automation illumination art!

Catherine demonstrates the motion-sensing trigger and color switching capabilities of the system.

A photoresistor monitors ambient brightness to raise and lower the brightness to match the time of day, i.e. it gets dimmer at night so that it doesn't blind my roommates on midnight snack runs.
